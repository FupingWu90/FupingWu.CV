## Curriculum Vitae


### Personal Profiles
Fuping Wu has obtained the doctoral degree from the Department of Statistics, School of Management, Fudan University recently.

Fuping Wu obtained his bachelor degree in medical laboratory science from Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in 2012, and obtained master degree in applied mathematics from Wuhan University in 2016. From 2016.07 to 2017.06, he was a research assistant in Shanghai Jiao Tong University. He began his doctorate in medical image computing in 2017.09, supervised by Prof. Xiahai Zhuang and Prof. Jianqing Fan in School of Data Science, and has graduated in June 2021.

His PhD topic is mainly focused on domain adaptation for multi-modal medical image segmentation, and semi-supervised learning for image classification and segmentation problems. He is interested in solving medical images analysis problems with machine learning approaches. Currently, he also works on incremental learning and reinforcement learning. In the future, he would like to extend the research interests to few-shot learning and federated learning.
